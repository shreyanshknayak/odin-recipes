        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Arroz caldo is a lugaw (glutinous rice dish) made with chicken and rice. It’s flavored with garlic, onions, ginger, fish sauce, and other seasonings. Though “arroz caldo” is a Spanish name, the dish’s origins are Filipino — it is an adaptation of a congee that was created by Chinese-Filipino immigrants. </p>

            <li>5 1/4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired (Optional)</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add chicken wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover, and cook another 2 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to a boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
